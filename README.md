# ARCHER2 - Data analytics using Python

Data Analytics refers to the manipulation, processing and analysis of data. In recent years, this area has undergone a revolution in which HPC has been a key driver. This one-day intermediate course provides an overview of data science and the analytical techniques that form its basis as well as exploring how HPC provides the power that has driven their adoption.
